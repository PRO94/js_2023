run js file in terminal
node fileName
(need to navigate to the folder with files or absolute path to the file):
node 01-variables.js

Working with DOM and scripts: 
if we put <script> to the head and trying to get access to some html element in the script - we will receive null value for that element because we're trying to get access to the html which is not loaded yet. 
So to fix the situation - need to put the script usage to the bottom of the html when it is loaded to the DOM. OR second way to fix it - need to add attribute defer:
<script src="./app.js" defer></script>
